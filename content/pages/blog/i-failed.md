excerpt: There are two way. We have to figure out which one is better.
---
When we want to achieve something, especially when it is really important, in most of the cases we have to take risks in order to get it.

And after all the effort we put in, the result says **NO**. We failed. For now, it is not our time to get it. 

> **What will happen next?**

Well, we are at some point where we have two options to go on with our lives.

The first one is to stay in a permanent disappointment state, overthinking about each negative piece, blocking up any possibility to learn something from ​the experience. In which case, we are just feeding our saboteur spirit and the only thing we learn is that we cannot do it.

The second one is to see failure as a lesson. Thereby, we can see the possibility of turning disappointment into motivation. It is not the solution, but it helps to face it in a different and constructive way.

> **So, is the second option better? Yes and No. Why?** 

An important part of learning about the mistake or failure is to know both sides of the coin and the only way to know our reaction in front of it is going through both options and comparing them in real life.

Therefore, if we want to capitalize our mistakes and internalize that the second option is convenientest, it is possible that we should go through the first one several times.
